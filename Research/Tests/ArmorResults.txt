Fractal scaling: At scale 1 and scale 9, max damage was roughly same so no noticable effect.

Level scaling: Higher level enemies have more armor.



WvW bonus:
Formula is damage/(armor * (1 + WvW)).

Converted damage with 5 WvW to damage with 3 WvW. Different was <1 in all values when comparing to real hits.
With formula damage/(armor / (1 - WvW)) damage was > 1 in some cases.


Comparing values with different wvw bonus resulted in wvw bonus being 1% smaller than indicated (like 5% is actually 4%).
With corrected values, total armor values ceils up!
