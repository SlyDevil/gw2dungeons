	<h2>Information on the site</h2>
	<p>I have personally gathered most enemy data but for health values I have used DPS tool from frifox. It can directly show enemy health values which makes those values accurate.</p>
	<p>For other values I have recorded enemy behavior and collected numbers like damage dealt and damage taken. From these videos I have checked cooldowns, animations and cast times. From collected numbers I have calculated enemy armor and skill strength using the damage formula. These values may not be exact.</p>
	<p>For fractals I have collected above data for multiple scales until I have been able to deduce the scaling rules. These values may not be exact.</p>
